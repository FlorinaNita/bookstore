        <h1><strong>10 Benefits of Reading: Why You Should Read Every Day</strong></h1>
        <p class="lead my-3">
        <h3>1. Mental Stimulation</h3>
        <p>Studies have shown that staying mentally stimulated can slow the progress of (or possibly even prevent)
            Alzheimer’s and Dementia, since keeping your brain active and engaged prevents it from losing power.
            Just like any other muscle in the body, the brain requires exercise to keep it strong and healthy, so
            the phrase “use it or lose it” is particularly apt when it comes to your mind. Doing puzzles and playing
            games such as chess have also been found to be helpful with cognitive stimulation.</p>
        <h3>2. Stress Reduction</h3>
        <p>No matter how much stress you have at work, in your personal relationships, or countless other issues
            faced in daily life, it all just slips away when you lose yourself in a great story. A well-written
            novel can transport you to other realms, while an engaging article will distract you and keep you in the
            present
            moment, letting tensions drain away and allowing you to relax.</p>
        <h3>3. Knowledge</h3>
        <p>Everything you read fills your head with new bits of information, and you never know when it might come
            in handy. The more knowledge you have, the better-equipped you are to tackle any challenge you’ll ever
            face.
            Additionally, here’s a bit of food for thought: should you ever find yourself in dire circumstances,
            remember that although you might lose everything else—your job, your possessions, your money, even your
            health—knowledge can never be taken from you.</p>
        <h3>4. Vocabulary Expansion</h3>
        <p>This goes with the above topic:
            The more you read, the more words you gain exposure to, and they’ll inevitably make their way into your
            everyday vocabulary.
            Being articulate and well-spoken is of great help in any profession, and knowing that you can speak to
            higher-ups with self-confidence can be an enormous boost to your self-esteem. It could even aid in your
            career, as those who are well-read, well-spoken, and knowledgeable on a variety of topics tend to get
            promotions more quickly (and more often) than those with smaller vocabularies and lack of awareness of
            literature, scientific breakthroughs, and global events.
            Reading books is also vital for learning new languages, as non-native speakers gain exposure to words
            used in context, which will ameliorate their own speaking and writing fluency.</p>
        <h3>5. Memory Improvement</h3>
        <p class="justify-content-sm-evenly">
            When you read a book, you have to remember an assortment of characters, their backgrounds, ambitions,
            history, and nuances, as well as the various arcs and sub-plots that weave their way through every
            story. That’s a fair bit to remember, but brains are marvellous things and can remember these things
            with relative ease.
            Amazingly enough, every new memory you create forges new synapses (brain pathways) and strengthens
            existing ones, which assists in short-term memory recall as well as stabilizing moods. How cool is
            that? </p>
        <h3>6. Stronger Analytical Thinking Skills</h3>
        <p>Have you ever read an amazing mystery novel, and solved the mystery yourself before finishing the book?
            If so, you were able to put critical and analytical thinking to work by taking note of all the details
            provided and sorting them out to determine “whodunnit”.
            That same ability to analyze details also comes in handy when it comes to critiquing the plot;
            determining whether it was a well-written piece, if the characters were properly developed, if the
            storyline ran smoothly, etc.
            Should you ever have an opportunity to discuss the book with others, you’ll be able to state your
            opinions clearly, as you’ve taken the time to really consider all the aspects involved.</p>
        <h3>7. Improved Focus and Concentration</h3>
        <p>In our internet-crazed world, attention is drawn in a million different directions at once as we
            multi-task through every day.
            In a single 5-minute span, the average person will divide their time between working on a task, checking
            email, chatting with a couple of people (via chat, skype, etc.), keeping an eye on Twitter, monitoring
            their smartphone, and interacting with co-workers. This type of ADD-like behaviour causes stress levels
            to rise, and lowers our productivity.
            When you read a book, all of your attention is focused on the story—the rest of the world just falls
            away, and you can immerse yourself in every fine detail you’re absorbing.
            Try reading for 15-20 minutes before work (i.e. on your morning commute, if you take public transit),
            and you’ll be surprised at how much more focused you are once you get to the office.
            Additional information: if you find staying focus hard and retrying to improve your focus, it’s
            possible you’ve been doing it wrong.</p>
        <h3>8. Better Writing Skills</h3>
        <p>This goes hand-in-hand with the expansion of your vocabulary:
            Exposure to published, well-written work has a noted effect on one’s own writing, as observing the
            cadence, fluidity, and writing styles of other authors will invariably influence your own work.
            In the same way that musicians influence one another and painters use techniques established by previous
            masters, so do writers learn how to craft prose by reading the works of others.</p>
        </p>
        <h3>9. Tranquility</h3>
        <p>In addition to the relaxation that accompanies reading a good book, it’s possible that the subject you
            read about can bring about immense inner peace and tranquility.
            Reading spiritual texts can lower blood pressure and bring about an immense sense of calm, while reading
            self-help books has been shown to help people suffering from certain mood disorders and mild mental
            illnesses.</p>
        <h3>10. Free Entertainment</h3>
        <p>Though many of us like to buy books so we can annotate them and dog-ear pages for future reference, they
            can be quite pricey.
            For low-budget entertainment, you can visit your local library and bask in the glory of the countless
            tomes available there for free. Libraries have books on every subject imaginable, and since they rotate
            their stock and constantly get new books, you’ll never run out of reading materials.
            If you happen to live in an area that doesn’t have a local library, or if you’re mobility-impaired and
            can’t get to one easily, most libraries have their books available in PDF or ePub format so you can read
            them on your e-reader, iPad, or your computer screen.
            There are also many sources online where you can download free e-books, so go hunting for something new
            to read!
            There’s a reading genre for every literate person on the planet, and whether your tastes lie in
            classical literature, poetry, fashion magazines, biographies, religious texts, young adult books,
            self-help guides, street lit, or romance novels, there’s something out there to capture your curiosity
            and imagination.
            Step away from your computer for a little while, crack open a book, and replenish your soul for a little
            while.</p>
